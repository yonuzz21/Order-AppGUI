# Order Application GUI

This is my very first GUI application. (Work in progress)


It is created using Python Tkinter module and it should be able to create a printable order list using the 
text field information provided by user.


I would like to receive feedback on how should I improve my coding skills to become a Python Developer.
Feel free to leave a comment, mentioning what should I change about the way the app was build and if the code inside was
readable and clear to understand.

Thank you! :D
