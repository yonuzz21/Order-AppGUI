# Order Application GUI

This is my very first GUI application. (Work in progress)


It is created using Python Tkinter module and it should be able to create a printable order list using the 
text field information provided by user.


I would like to receive feedback on how should I improve my coding skills to become a Python Developer.
Feel free to leave a comment, mentioning what should I change about the way the app was build and if the code inside was
readable and clear to understand.

Thank you! :D


Update 1.2 : 

-Added Total Amount Entry field that shows the total order 

-Now the Bill buton will display the order on the right panel(  name, quantity, total)

-Check button wil show the Total Amount

-Error message will be generated if the fields are empty

Current Bugs:

-The order display area can be modified after the data is displayed (must be Read-Only)

- If the fields exceeds 200 qty the Bill area data will be displayed incorectly (Create a limit of 200 or Change how the data  is displayed)
